**Activity state**

An activity can be thought of as being in one of several states:

**starting:** In process of loading up, but not fully loaded.

**running:** Done loading and now visible on the screen.

**paused:** Partially obscured or out of focus, but not shut down.

**stopped:** No longer active, but still in the device's active memory.

**destroyed:** Shut down and no longer currently loaded in memory.

# About:
This applicaion is build for showing the examplary working of life-cycle activity methods. These methods are like: onCreate, onPause, onResume, onStop, onDestroy, and so on. These methods are called by itseelf when certain action is performed in the application. Like: onPause() method will be called when user will minimize the application or when any other activity will intrupt the application. In this way every life-cycle method is called for certain tasks.
